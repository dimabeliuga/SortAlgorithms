#Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
A real-time sorting algorithm visualizer built with C++ and ncurses library. This interactive terminal application allows you to watch various sorting algorithms in action with colorful animations and customizable settings.
ðŸš§ Development Status
This project is currently under active development. New features, algorithms, and improvements are being added regularly. Feel free to contribute or report issues!
âœ¨ Features

Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms with smooth animations
Color-coded elements for easy understanding:

ðŸ”µ Blue: Normal elements
ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Elements being compared
ðŸ”´ Red: Elements being swapped
ðŸŸ¢ Green: Sorted elements
ðŸŸ£ Purple: Pivot elements (for Quick Sort)

Interactive menu with keyboard controls
Adjustable animation speed (10-1000ms delay)
Random data generation for testing
Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows with proper setup)
