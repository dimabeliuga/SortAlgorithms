# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A real-time sorting algorithm visualizer built with C++ and ncurses library. This interactive terminal application allows you to watch various sorting algorithms in action with colorful animations and customizable settings.

# Development Status
This project is currently under active development. New features, algorithms, and improvements are being added regularly. Feel free to contribute or report issues!

# Features

Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms with smooth animations
Color-coded elements for easy understanding:

1. Blue: Normal elements

2. Yellow: Elements being compared

3. Red: Elements being swapped

4. Green: Sorted elements

5. Purple: Pivot elements (for Quick Sort)

Adjustable animation speed (10-1000ms delay)

Random data generation for testing

# Currently Implemented Algorithms

1. Bubble Sort - Classic O(nÂ²) comparison-based algorithm
2. Insertion Sort - Efficient for small datasets
3. Selection Sort - Simple selection-based sorting
4. Quick Sort - Divide-and-conquer algorithm with pivot selection

# Planned Features

 1. Merge Sort visualization
 2. Heap Sort visualization
 3. Radix Sort visualization
 4. Cocktail Sort visualization
 5. Comb Sort visualization
 6. Performance comparison mode
 7. Sound effects for operations
 8. Save/load configurations
 9. Custom array input
 10. Algorithm complexity information display
 11. Step-by-step mode
 12. Multiple sorting windows
